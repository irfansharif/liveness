- Want to build a failure detector module
- The module is intended to be embedded into a server/node component
- It'll delegate network I/O to the component it's embedded into
- Internally it'll makes sense of the messages, and will update it's internal
  state accordingly (similar to etcd/raft)
- Want this to sit behind an interface, with two different implementations
  - One implementation would be identical to crdb's existing liveness system
  - One would be the proposed lightweight alternative
- Separately from that, we'll want to construct a simulator with various
  control knobs to induce specific failure modes. The simulator will use both
  implementations and spit out results (for e.g. how long it takes to converge
  on failures, what failures are detectable, what aren't). These results will
  let us evaluate the various implementations.
  We probably want to start with making the simulator single threaded, for
  simulation determinism. And make timing all tick based. It's a discrete-event
  simulator.
- Other names: membership, memberlist, group. group.Invite, group.Remove. Peer.
- Implement other membership variants. Start with global Raft? Then with
localized Raft with set of membership nodes.
